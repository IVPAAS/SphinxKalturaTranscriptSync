	<textarea> Architecture from Wikipedia the free encyclopedia en.wikipedia.org 
Architecture (from Latin, architectura and ultimately from Greek, "a master builder", from "chiefs, leader" , "builder, carpenter") is the art and science of designing buildings and 
structures. A wider definition would include within its scope also the design of the total built 
environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the 
microlevel of creating furniture. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and 
cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user. Planned architecture often 
manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing 
aesthetics. This distinguishes it from applied science or engineering, which usually concentrate 
more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures. 
In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, 
such as for a hospital or a stadium, to the apparently simpler, such as planning residential houses. 
Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political symbols, and/or works of art.  
The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less 
than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live. 
Romans absorbed brightness and rituals based in Greek Architecture; the Temple and all Gods, the  
√Ågora (specific place for special or casual meeting), and, building the Colosseum of Rome, they  
represent all orders, Doric, Ionic e Corinthian. Le Corbusier said: "You employ stone, wood, and  
concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity  
is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: "This is beautiful. 
That is Architecture. Art enters in. This sound file and all text in the article are licensed under

	<textarea>We use Altus for two events. The primary event is called Insight, which is a technical conference that we've been putting on for about 12 years. We invite all our internal sales engineering folks, which is our pre sales folks that are responsible for assisting our sales reps in the field. We also invite our partners to the event. We have about 90 different sessions, ranging from 1 hour to 3 hours in length. As you can imagine, the biggest complaint that we get is people can't see all the sessions. One of the ways that we use Altus is to capture the content that people can't see, so that we can reuse that content when they get back to the field and view the sessions that they didn't get to see. So what this allows is an attendee, or person who didn't attend the event, to view content that was provided at the Insight technical conference. What the Altus vSearch tool does is allow a person to look for any spoken word that occurred during the conference and actually view that particular presentation. So an example would be, if somebody's looking for multitenancy, we can actually put the word in the vSearch tool and it can go specifically to those topics that were mentioned at the event and watch the presentation from the moment those words were spoken. This is a phenomenal tool for the person out in the field who has to look up particular topics and be an expert in literally seconds before he goes in front of a customer.
